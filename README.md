This was a collaboration between the frontend students and interaction design students at Fagskolen Kristiania. We got four hours to design and develop a web application for adding and displaying recipes.

The home page lets you add a recipe with title, category, ingredients and instructions. The recipies get stored in the local storage, insuring that they don't disappear when you refresh the page. To view your recipes, click on the "My recipes" button in the navigation bar. Either view all of your recipes, or use the three filtering buttons to view only the recipes with the category breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

Our priority was on the adding, storing and displaying functionality. As a result, not everything is 100% finished in terms of design and styling. Either way, we were quite proud of everything we achieved in such a short amount of time. So were our teachers, who announced us the winners of hackathon 2024!
